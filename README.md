QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

• Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

• Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

Canceled: 
Pledged Std Dev: $35,632.42 
Percent Funded Std Dev: 26.67% 

Failed: 
Pledged Std Dev: $45,774.53 
Percent Funded Std Dev: 29.25% 

Live: 
Pledged Std Dev: $52,169.66 
Percent Funded Std Dev: 29.16% 

Successful: 
Pledged Std Dev: $64,552.37 
Percent Funded Std Dev: 284.38%

Observations and Analysis:
Successful campaigns exhibit much higher variability in both the amount pledged and the percentage funded compared to canceled, failed, or live campaigns. 
The standard deviation is notably higher for successful campaigns, especially in the 'percent funded' metric. 
This higher variability in successful campaigns can be attributed to the fact that once a campaign is successful, it might continue to attract funding well beyond its original goal. This leads to a wide range of 'percent funded' values and larger sums being pledged.

In contrast, failed campaigns typically do not reach their goals, which limits the variability in how much they are over or under their target.

Conclusion: The higher variability in successful campaigns does make sense because they can vary widely in how much they exceed their goals. This is not the case for failed campaigns, which are more likely to cluster around lower funding levels due to not reaching their funding goals. These insights can be quite useful for understanding the dynamics of crowdfunding campaigns and could be used for further detailed analyses or strategic planning for new campaigns.
